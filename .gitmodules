# This file is intentionally empty.
# Rationale: The repository previously referenced an `agents` submodule.
# Cloudflare's build environment runs `git submodule update --init --recursive`
# by default and fails if `.gitmodules` has an incomplete entry.
# Leaving this file empty explicitly indicates there are no submodules.
